/**
 * The Subsystem abstract class, which serves as a basic framework for all robot subsystems. Each
 * subsystem outputs commands to SmartDashboard, has a stop routine (for after each match), and a
 * routine to zero all sensors, which helps with calibration.
 *
 * <p>All Subsystems only have one instance (after all, one robot does not have two drivetrains),
 * and functions get the instance of the drivetrain and act accordingly. Subsystems are also a state
 * machine with a desired state and actual state; the robot code will try to match the two states
 * with actions. Each Subsystem also is responsible for instantiating all member components at the
 * start of the match.
